Welcome to the 13th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup’s
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

## Game Updates

### [Way of Rhea]

[![Anthropic's virtual booth at Play NYC](way-of-rhea-play-nyc.png)][Way of Rhea]

[Way of Rhea] has a [free demo][Way of Rhea] temporarily available as part of
[Play NYC]!

Way of Rhea is a puzzle platformer that takes place in a world where you can
only interact with items that match your current color.

The new demo includes a level that wasn't part of the Steam Game Festival,
showing off how circuit puzzles will work in the game. Since Play NYC
couldn't be in person this year, the devs temporarily themed this level to look
like last year's Play NYC venue, included placing virtual booths for other games
throughout the level.
