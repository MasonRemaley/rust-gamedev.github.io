Welcome to the 33rd issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

## Game Updates

### [Way of Rhea][wor]

![way of rhea capsule image](wor-capsule.jpg)

[Way of Rhea][wor] is a puzzle adventure with hard puzzles and forgiving
mechanics being produced by [@masonremaley][wor-mason-remaley] in a custom Rust
engine. It has a demo available [on Steam][wor].

Way of Rhea was recently [shown off at PAX East!][wor-pax]. A
[minor patch][wor-update] has been released to [the demo][wor] since PAX:

- An issue that made the last puzzle in the third forest level difficult to
navigate with a controller was worked around
- Colliders in the Hermes puzzle were fixed (previously you cold land on top of
a gate if you held left while sliding)
- The attract mode that was used at PAX has been merged (not in demo)
- More jungle biome scenery has been placed (not in demo)
- A crash at startup on CPUs that don't support the `andn` instruction was fixed
(part of the BMI extension to x64)
- The game can now generate mini dumps on Windows and Linux in the event that it
crashes, and if given consent, forward them to the developer for analysis for
easier debugging

You can stay up to date with the latest Way of Rhea developments by
